# node-module-cleaner

A simple and efficient CLI tool to **recursively find and delete `node_modules` folders** from a directory tree â€” with size estimates and confirmation prompts.

## Features

-   Scans for all folders matching a given name (default: `node_modules`)
-   Calculates and displays disk space usage per folder
-   Confirms before deletion (optional `--force` flag to skip)
-   Skips nested matches to avoid double-counting
-   Fast and dependency-free (uses native Node.js)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g node-module-cleaner
```

Or use directly via `npx`:

```bash
npx node-module-cleaner
```

## Usage

```bash
node-module-cleaner [options]
```
